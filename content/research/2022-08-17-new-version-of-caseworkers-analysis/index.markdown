My first article is out in the *International Public Management Journal*! 

Here is the abstract from the paper:

> When facing a disobedient client, caseworkers are often required to impose sanctions. Even when sanctions are explicitly required by law, however, research shows that caseworkers may turn a blind eye.

> Why so? This study asks how certain clients can merit themselves to avoid sanctioning.

> Theorizing from the notion of client deservingness, we develop a theoretical account of how certain client attributes cause frontline workers to bend the rules. Drawing from a novel conjoint experiment among Danish unemployment caseworkers (n = 407 with 1,210 observations), we show how caseworkers tend to favor stronger clients when bending the rules in clientsâ€™ favor. 

> Clients who appear motivated, who have not been sanctioned in the past, and who have more past job experience are all less likely to be sanctioned.

> Our findings reveal a paradox: Although welfare usually targets clients in need, avoiding welfare sanctions seems based on client resources. Consequently, caseworker rule-bending can have unintended distributional consequences since stronger clients are those who can get away with disobedience.

And here is key figure from the paper:

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a data scientist and PhD student currently finishing my dissertation in Political Science at the University of Copenhagen. My research centers on welfare encounters between frontline workers and their clients.  

My interests covers data visualization, statistical simulation, and communicating statistics to practitioners. Also, I'm passionate about sourdough baking, coffee with friends, and semi-gloomy Norwegian novels. I live in Copenhagen with my fiance and and our baby boy, Jakob.

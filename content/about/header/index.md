<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a PhD Candidate working on experimental and behavioral public administration research. Specifically, I study how frontline workers make professional judgements and decisions, and how these affect citizens.   

My research interests include data visualization, statistical simulation, and communicating statistics to practitioners. Besides from that, I also happen to love sourdough baking, having coffee with friends, and reading gloomy Norwegian novels at night (Petterson, Espedal, Knausgaard). I live in Copenhagen with my fianc√© and our baby boy, Jakob.

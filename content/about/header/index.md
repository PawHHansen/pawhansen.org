<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a PhD Candidate working on experimental and behavioral public administration research. At the moment, I study how frontline workers make professional judgements, and how these affect their clients.    

My research interests also include data visualization, statistical simulation, and communicating statistics to practitioners. Besides from that, I enjoy sourdough baking, having coffee with friends, and reading gloomy novels in the evenings. I live in Copenhagen with my wife and our baby boy, Jakob.

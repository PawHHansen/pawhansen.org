  Hi, I'm Paw! Good to see you.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a PhD Candidate working on experimental and behavioral public administration research. Specifically, I study how frontline workers make professional judgements and decisions, and how these affect citizens. I hold an MSc in Political Science.    

My academic interests include data visualization, statistical simulation, and communicating statistics to practitioners. I also happen to love sourdough baking, having coffee with friends, and reading gloomy Norwegian novels at night (Petterson, Espedal, Knausgaard). I live in Copenhagen with my fianc√© and our baby boy, Jakob.
